This is my first gvim color scheme and it has been adapted from a wonderful .emacs file I found online by someone named Brad Settlemyer (http://deepcopy.org/emacs/dotemacs).  Since I moved to vim I had been looking for a theme like this and I couldn't find one so I tried my best to re-create it.

You can find a screenshot on the color scheme list here:
